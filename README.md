Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how you developed your personal portfolio website, which can help you articulate your process during an interview:

Step-by-Step Explanation of Building the Personal Portfolio Website:
Step 1: Planning and Designing the Website
Before writing any code, I outlined the key sections and content I wanted to include in my portfolio website. These sections were:

Header (with navigation menu and introduction)
About Me (with tabs for Skills, Experience, and Education)
Services (offering details of services like web design, app development)
Portfolio (showcasing previous projects)
Contact (contact form and social media links)
I created a wireframe design and chose a clean, modern look that aligns with a developer's portfolio. This step also involved selecting a color scheme (black background with vibrant red highlights), fonts, and icons (from FontAwesome).

Step 2: Setting Up HTML Structure
Once I had a clear design plan, I started by writing the HTML to structure the website:

I created sections using <div> elements and applied semantic HTML tags like <nav>, <ul>, and <header>.
The Header Section included my name, title (Front-end Developer), and a navigation menu with links to different sections of the page. The links were anchored with IDs (e.g., #about, #portfolio) to allow smooth scrolling.
The About Section was structured with tabs for switching between content (Skills, Experience, Education).
The Services Section included boxes for services offered, each with a title, description, and icon.
In the Portfolio Section, I created a grid layout to display images of projects with hover effects showing project details.
The Contact Section featured a form where users can submit their name, email, and a message, along with social media icons for connections.
Step 3: Styling with CSS
After the HTML structure was set, I moved on to styling the website:

I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. For example, in the Services and Portfolio sections, I used CSS Grid to create rows and columns that adjust dynamically.
To maintain consistency, I applied a global reset (using * selector) and set the default font and box-sizing across the entire site.
I styled the header with a background image and adjusted the text size for responsiveness. I also used CSS media queries to make sure the layout worked on mobile and tablet devices.
For the navigation menu, I added hover effects to the links using pseudo-elements (::after), giving it a modern touch.
I styled the tabbed content in the About Section using active and inactive states, controlling visibility through CSS classes.
FontAwesome icons were added to buttons, navigation menus, and the services section for enhanced visuals.
For the contact form, I styled the input fields and buttons to fit within the overall design.
Step 4: Making the Website Interactive with JavaScript
Once the basic structure and styles were in place, I added interactivity using JavaScript:

Tab Functionality: In the About Me section, I added a JavaScript function that dynamically switches between tabs (Skills, Experience, Education) based on the user’s selection. This was done using event listeners to add and remove the active class to display the relevant tab content.

javascript
Copy code
var tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tab-links");
var tabcontents = document.getElementsByClassName("tab-contents");

function opentab(tabname) {
    for(tablink of tablinks){
        tablink.classList.remove("active-link");
    }
    for(tabcontent of tabcontents){
        tabcontent.classList.remove("active-tab");
    }
    event.currentTarget.classList.add("active-link");
    document.getElementById(tabname).classList.add("active-tab");
}
Mobile Navigation Menu: I implemented a JavaScript toggle for the mobile navigation menu, which opens and closes the sidebar menu on smaller screens. This provided a better user experience on mobile devices.

javascript
Copy code
var sidemenu = document.getElementById("sidemenu");

function openmenu() {
    sidemenu.style.right = "0";
}

function closemenu() {
    sidemenu.style.right = "-200px";
}
Step 5: Adding Project Content and Portfolio
I added my projects to the Portfolio Section, where each project image is wrapped in a container with a hover effect. When users hover over a project, a description of the project appears, and they are given the option to view more details through a button that links to external resources or the project itself.

Each project was displayed using an image inside a grid layout, with hover effects applied through CSS transitions.

Step 6: Contact Form and Social Media Links
In the Contact Section, I created a form where visitors can submit their name, email, and message. Although the form does not have back-end functionality (such as email processing) in this version, it visually demonstrates how visitors can reach out.

I also included social media links using FontAwesome icons for platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram, which are key to networking and building a developer profile.

Step 7: Testing and Making Responsive Adjustments
After coding the website, I conducted testing to ensure everything worked properly:

I checked the responsiveness by adjusting the screen size in my browser's developer tools, ensuring that the site displayed correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
I made adjustments to the layout for smaller screen sizes by using CSS Media Queries to reduce text sizes, change layouts from grid to single-column, and hide certain elements (like the full navigation menu) when viewed on mobile devices.
Step 8: Deployment
The final step involved deploying the website. I set it up on a free or paid hosting service (such as GitHub Pages or Netlify) to make it publicly accessible for employers, clients, or colleagues to view.

Final Thoughts
By following these steps, I was able to build a fully responsive, interactive portfolio website. The project showcases my skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and user interaction. It also demonstrates my ability to manage a project from design through to deployment.
